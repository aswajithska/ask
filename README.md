**A Data-Driven Approach to Breast Cancer Prediction**

This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on several key features. The project utilized a dataset of breast cancer data and explored the performance of several classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. After an initial comparison, the Random Forest model was selected for further optimization. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV was performed to identify the optimal set of parameters for the Random Forest model. The final, tuned model achieved an accuracy of over 94% and an AUC score of 0.98 on the test set, demonstrating its high predictive power and reliability in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors. This project successfully demonstrates the potential of machine learning models, particularly Random Forests, in providing accurate and reliable predictions for breast cancer diagnosis, which can be a valuable tool for medical professionals.
